# Quantum Circuit Composition

This module defines quantum circuits as sequences of gate applications
and provides their semantics (as unitary matrix products).

A circuit on n qubits is represented as a list of `GateStep n` values.
The circuit's matrix is the product of the step matrices in order.

/-- A single step in a quantum circuit: a gate applied to a subset of qubits.
    For simplicity in this scaffold, we represent the full embedded n-qubit unitary
    directly. See `Gate.tensorWithId` for constructing embedded gates. -/

abbrev Circuit (n : ℕ) := List (GateStep n)

/-! ## Circuit semantics -/

/-- The unitary matrix of a circuit (product of gate matrices, left-to-right).
    `circuitMatrix [U₁, U₂, ..., Uₖ]` = Uₖ · ... · U₂ · U₁
    (i.e., the first gate is applied first, so it appears rightmost in the product). -/
def circuitMatrix {n : ℕ} (c : Circuit n) : QGate n :=
  c.foldr (fun step acc => step.unitary * acc) 1

-- Note: foldr with initial value 1 and operation U * acc gives
-- U₁ * (U₂ * (... * (Uₖ * 1))) = U₁ * U₂ * ... * Uₖ
-- which means U₁ is applied first (rightmost in conventional matrix notation).

    circuitMatrix (seqComp c₁ c₂) = circuitMatrix c₁ * circuitMatrix c₂ :=
  circuitMatrix_append c₁ c₂

/-- The circuit resulting from reversing a list of gates is the inverse circuit. -/
lemma circuitMatrix_reverse {n : ℕ} (c : Circuit n) :
    circuitMatrix c.reverse = (circuitMatrix c)⁻¹ := by
  sorry
  -- Proof: By induction. (U₁ · U₂ · ... · Uₖ)⁻¹ = Uₖ⁻¹ · ... · U₂⁻¹ · U₁⁻¹
  -- and reversing the list gives Uₖ · ... · U₁, each of which equals its own inverse
  -- in the unitary group.
